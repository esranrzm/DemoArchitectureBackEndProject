# Sample .NET Core 6 BackEnd Project
Welcome to the README for our .NET 6 backend project! This project is designed to handle user management, user operation claims, and operation claims efficiently through the use of Entity Framework, Fluent Validation, OTP (One-Time Password), DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), and other SOLID principles.


## Project Overview

My backend project provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the following entities:

*  Users: Users are individuals who interact with our system. They can be authenticated and authorized to perform specific operations.
*  User Operation Claims: These represent specific permissions or claims assigned to users, defining what actions they can perform within the system.
* Operation Claims: These are the individual operations or permissions that can be assigned to users.

## Technologies Used
* Our project leverages the following technologies and frameworks:
* .NET 6: The latest version of the .NET framework for building scalable and performant applications.
* Entity Framework: A powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for interacting with the database.
* Fluent Validation: A library for defining and enforcing validation rules in a fluent manner.
* OTP (One-Time Password): Used for enhancing security through two-factor authentication.
* DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Used to transfer data between different layers of the application, improving separation of concerns.
