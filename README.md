# Sample .NET Core 6 BackEnd Project
Welcome to the README for our .NET 6 backend project! This project is designed to handle user management, user operation claims, and operation claims efficiently through the use of Entity Framework, Fluent Validation, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), and other SOLID principles.


## Project Overview

My backend project provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the following entities:

*  Users: Users are individuals who interact with our system. They can be authenticated and authorized to perform specific operations.
*  User Operation Claims: These represent specific permissions or claims assigned to users, defining what actions they can perform within the system.
* Operation Claims: These are the individual operations or permissions that can be assigned to users.

## Technologies Used
* Our project leverages the following technologies and frameworks:
* .NET 6: The latest version of the .NET framework for building scalable and performant applications.
* Entity Framework: A powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for interacting with the database.
* Fluent Validation: A library for defining and enforcing validation rules in a fluent manner.
* DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Used to transfer data between different layers of the application, improving separation of concerns.
